Analyze the student's spending habits provided in the JSON spending data.

Based on the data, identify 2-3 specific patterns or areas for potential savings.

For each area, provide:
1.  **insight**: A brief, data-driven observation (e.g., "Your spending on Canteen food is frequent.").
2.  **suggestion**: A practical, actionable tip to reduce that spending (e.g., "Packing lunch from the mess twice a week could cut costs.").
3.  **potentialMonthlySavings**: A realistic, calculated estimate of how much money (in ₹) the student could save per month if they follow the tip.

Also consider the contextual knownTips to guide your suggestions.
